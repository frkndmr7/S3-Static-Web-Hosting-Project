# S3-Static-Web-Hosting-Project
I created a static website containing my portfolio using Html - Css. I wanted to run this website in the cloud using AWS's S3 service. First I created a Bucket in the S3 service. Then I uploaded the website's files here. I chose S3 Standard as the storage class because I wanted to update frequently. If I had a file that I would access less frequently, I would have chosen the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access class. I made the Bucket publicly accessible in the “Permission” section because I want everyone to see my portfolio. AWS does not make public access by default for security reasons. Then I enabled the Static Web Hosting feature in the “Properties” section by selecting the necessary files. After it was enabled, an endpoint (http://bitirmeproject.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com) was created. This link is created in the order of “bucket-name”, “s3-website”, “region-name”, “amazonaws.com”. You can access my portfolio from the link below.
